└── reports/          # Generated reports and findings
```

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Place your Excel data files in the `data/raw/` directory.

3. Run the main analysis script:
   ```
   python axionray_complete_analysis.py
   ```

## Usage

- `axionray_complete_analysis.py`: Main script that runs the complete analysis pipeline
- Individual task scripts are organized in their respective directories under `src/`
- Generated outputs are saved in the `outputs/` directory
